Hi, I'm Shafin.

I'm passionate about all things software, and spend most of my time [building tools on my own]({{<ref "/projects/index.md" >}}). 

So far I've built compilers, interpreters, gaming console emulators, web applications, chrome extensions, android apps and many more.

I recently worked at [Facebook](https://facebook.com) on their [static analysis tools team](https://engineering.fb.com/2019/08/15/security/zoncolan/). Previously, I also worked at [Twitter](https://twitter.com) and [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/).

I am a big fan of [functional programming](https://ocaml.org/). 

I currently attend the [University of Toronto](https://fas.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Computer-Science).

Follow my work on [Github](https://github.com/shafinsiddique) or on my personal [blog]({{<ref "/posts/" >}}).
